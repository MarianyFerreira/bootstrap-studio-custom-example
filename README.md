# bootstrap-studio-custom-example

## Requirements:

### Clone or Download the repository
     $ git clone https://github.com/MarianyFerreira/bootstrap-studio-custom-example.git

### SASS compiler with Bootstrap Studio. Follow: https://bootstrapstudio.io/tutorials/writing-sass

To keep file size low, we don't bundle a SASS compiler with Bootstrap Studio. Instead, we provide an easy to install utility that works together with the app to compile your SASS code. It is called bstudio-sass and supports Windows, macOS and Linux.

 - Download bstudio-sass for your operating system. (Windows, Linux, macOS) or unzip bstudio-sass-windows (64bit).zip (Windows)

 - Extract it somewhere on your computer. Keep the two files in the same folder.
 - Open the File > Design Settings dialog and switch to the SASS tab.
 - Enter the full path to the extracted bstudio-sass executable. Make sure that the path includes the bstudio-sass file. As a test, if you  paste the full path in your terminal and hit Enter it should be executed.
 - Hit the Save button to close the dialog.
 
 ### Load Project
